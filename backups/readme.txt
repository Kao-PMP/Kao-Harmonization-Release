These are straight dumps from the database for tables created by this project, not normally part of ohdsi. As dumps, they contain both the schema (create table) and the data.

There are rows added to standard ohdsi tables: concept. In the sql directory is a file, concept.sql, that adds rows there.


Also included are csv files from DAve's pipeline, phenotypeset.csv and phenotypelist.csv that have been munged into forms that can be easily compared to output analaysis matrices from this pipeline: backups/paradigm_phenotype_table_dr_id_sorted.csv
